# Modern Bank Landing Page

- Re-created from a figma file

## Folders

- components
- constants, holds all of our content we display on the page (read a blog post that discussed using this method instead of directly writing inside the component)

## Styles File

- Saw a discussion that styling with Tailwind you could create custom styles for containers and components within your site. This allows you to import specific styles using a template string and keeps the code base cleaner without bloated classNames
